        equations (PDEs) for the solution of the optical flow problem. The
        problem is modeled using the heat transfer process.  Instead of using
        PDEs, we propose to use the global equation of heat conservation. We
        use a computational algebraic topology-based image model which allows
        us to encode some underlying physical laws by linking a global value
        on a domain with values on its boundary. The numerical scheme is
        derived in a straightforward way from the problem modeled and provides
        a physical explanation of each solving step. Experimental results are
        presented.},

        based upon a decomposition of the linear elasticity problem into basic
        physical laws. Unlike other methods which solve the partial differential
        equation arising from the physical laws by numerical techniques, we
        encode the basic laws using computational algebraic topology.
        Conservative laws use exact global values while constitutive allow to
        make wise assumptions using some knowledge about the problem and the
        domain. The deformations computed with our approach have a physical
        interpretation. Furthermore, our algorithm performs with either 2D or
        3D problems.  We finally present an application of the model in
        updating road databases and results validating our approach.},

on a domain with values on its boundary. The numerical scheme is derived in a
straightforward way from the problem modeled, thus providing a physical
explanation for each step in the solution. We apply the scheme to two

    abstract = {An algorithm for the simultaneous filling-in of texture and structure in
        regions of missing image information is presented in this paper. The basic idea
        is to first decompose the image into the sum of two functions with different
        basic characteristics, and then reconstruct each one of these functions
        separately with structure and texture filling-in algorithms. The first
        function used in the decomposition is of bounded variation, representing
        the underlying image struc-ture, while the second function captures the
        texture and possible noise. The region of missing information in the bounded
        variation image is reconstructed using image in-painting algorithms, while
        the same region in the texture image is filled-in with texture synthesis
        techniques. The original image is then reconstructed adding back these
        two sub-images. The novel contribution of this paper is then in the
        combination of these three previously developed components, image
        decomposition with inpainting and texture synthesis, which permits
        the simultaneous use of filling-in algorithms that are suited for
        different image characteristics. Examples on real images show the
        advantages of this proposed approach.},

    volume = 2,
    pages = {721--728},
    abstract = {A new algorithm is proposed for removing large objects from digital
        images. The challenge is to fill in the hole that is left behind in a visually
        plausible way. In the past, this problem has been addressed by two classes of
        algorithms: (i) texture synthesis algorithms for generating large image regions
        from sample textures, and (ii) inpainting techniques for filling in small image
        gaps. The former work well for textures  repeating two-dimensional patterns
        with some stochasticity; the latter focus on linear structures which can be
        thought of as one-dimensional patterns, such as lines and object contours. This
        paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm that combines the advantages of
        these two approaches. We first note that exemplar-based texture synthesis contains
        the essential process required to replicate both texture and structure; the
        success of structure propagation, however, is highly dependent on the order in
        which the filling proceeds. We propose a best-first algorithm in which the
        confidence in the synthesized pixel values is propagated in a manner similar
        to the propagation of information in inpainting. The actual colour values are
        computed using exemplar-based synthesis. Computational efficiency is achieved
        by a block-based sampling process. A number of examples on real and synthetic
        images demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in removing large occluding
        objects as well as thin scratches. Robustness with respect to the shape of the
        manually selected target region is also demonstrated. Our results compare
        favorably to those obtained by existing techniques.},

        the emergence of a new methodology within the algorithmic framework of Partial Differential
        Equations (PDE) for the resolution of such problems. This PDE based methodology, whose
        introduction within image processing has occurred only recently, allows to handle
        efficiently a number of non linear problems (existence and uniqueness of solution,
        efficient numerical schemes for the implementation part..) Some of the ideas developped

        of problems in the domain of computer vision, such as in low-level vision, stereovision,
        motion analysis, shape from shading, etc. This report is a non-exhaustive review of the

        An efficient implementation using an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter is
        provided. This implementation has the additional advantage that increasing the
        filter scale affects neither temporal nor spatial complexity. The detection
        algorithm for junctions and terminations is divided into two steps. First, given
        the lines extracted from the original image, a local measure of line curvature
        is estimated using the mean of the dot products of orientation vectors within a
        given neighbourhood. The second step involves the localization of junctions and
        terminations. Experimental results using several synthetic and real images
